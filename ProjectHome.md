`CloudCourse` is a course scheduling system.

Built entirely on App Engine, `CloudCourse` allows anyone to create and track learning activities.  It also offers calendaring, waitlist management and approval features.


`CloudCourse` is fully integrated with Google Calendar and can be further customized for your organization with the following service provider interfaces (replaceable components):

  * Sync service - to sync `CloudCourse` data with your internal systems
  * Room info service - to schedule classes in your locations
  * User info service - to look up user profile (employee title, picture, etc)

`CloudCourse` has been developed in Python, using the Django web application framework and the Closure Javascript library.
