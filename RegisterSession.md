## Registration Steps ##
  1. Go to activity page. Say Penguins 101.
  1. Under sessions look at the session you like to attend. Say Monday 10:00am next week.
  1. Click on "Register" button for the session if available. If this button is disabled then you cannot register for this session due to some business rule blocking a registration.
  1. Clicking on "Register" provides a confirmation dialog where you can choose specific room locations if the session is held in multiple rooms. Click "ok" to confirm the registration.
  1. Once you confirmed the registration the registration button is replaced by your registration status of either _Enrolled_ or _Waitlisted_ or _Pending_ as discussed in following sections.

## Unregistration Steps ##
  1. Go to home page, click on the enrolled session link from the homepage/enrolled session page. This should take you to the activity page showing this specific session.
  1. Since you are already enrolled the button should say "cancel". Click the button and confirm on pop up dialog to unregister from the session. A confirmation email will be sent along with cleaning up your calendar entries for the session timeslots.
  1. If the "cancel" button is no longer enabled it means that the session is no longer allowing to unregister due to business rules, example - course already started and cannot unregister.

## Registration Status ##
Each session on the activity page displays a status relevant to the user visiting the page. The status could be one of the following:
  * _OPEN_ - The session is open for the user and not all seats are taken yet. This status also shows how many remaining seats are left in a session.
  * _FULL_ - The session is open for the user but the seats are all taken, most likely the user will be placed on a waitlist. This status shows the number of people already on the waitlist.
  * _Enrolled_ - The user is enrolled and confirmed for the session.
  * _Waitlisted_ - The user is cleared to join the session but isn't confirmed due to over subscription to the course. The waitlist rank of the user is shown to give an idea of the changes the user can be confirmed to the course (So many users should unregister before the user can be confirmed for the course.)
  * _Pending_ - The user is not yet cleared to join the session due to some business rule. Example - Session needs a manager approval and the approval wasn't received yet. The reasons for the pending status can be seen by hovering over the "?" icon next to the pending status.
  * _Restricted_ - The user cannot (un)register for the class because of some business rule, example - only full time employees are allowed, course has already started etc. The reason for the restricted status can be seen by hovering over the "?" icon next to the restricted status.
